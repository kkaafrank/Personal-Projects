# Tap-Titans-2-Raid-Tracker

This is the program I wrote to process the data output by the Tap Titans 2 raid output. It takes the data in the form of 
a .txt file and outputs it outputs it to a .xml file that is intended to be opened in Excel.

When copy/pasting the data into raid.txt, make sure that there is no extraneous line at the end of the text file. The file should end with the last line of data.
